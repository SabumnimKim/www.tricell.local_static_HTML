# Frontend Design

## Overview
This repository contains an example of a simple frontend web design using HTML 4, CSS, and frontend JavaScript.

It is a student project within the university course **"Frontend Development" (5 ECTS)** offered by Åland University of Applied Sciences.

The purpose is to teach first-year university students how to read, interpret, and structure frontend code, and to understand the historical development of web technologies.

HTML5, responsive design, and modern UI principles are introduced later in the course **"User Interface Design" (5 ECTS)**.  
This example intentionally demonstrates the limitations of older techniques in order to explain why modern web standards evolved.
